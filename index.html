This job was great at teaching skills needed to repairing, planning, budgeting, being timely and efficient with our money and time.</p>

                            <p>After getting back from my two-year mission in Oklahoma, I worked at Margarita's Bar & Grille for a few months before moving to Utah for school. Within these few months I was trusted enough to be the morning shift manager. During my brief time here we implemented new ideas such as a better drive through, opening up early for our breakfast meals, and hosting a podcast show in our restaurant. </p>

                            <p>After moving to Provo and strating school, I began a part-time job at El Gallo Giro. This job taught me to be calm when overwhelemed, to strengthen my customer-service manners and always greet with a smile. Being in a big city, this restaurant was always busy so I learned the importance of communicating with my coworkers so we could get things done in a timely manner.  </p>

Having clear windows to see the exterior gives a better look to the insiders. And for restoration jobs, just like Bob the Builder, "Can we fix it? Yes we can!". From fire damages to floods, we restore whatever damage has been done to the homes. </p>

                    <p>As a full-time student, when I have time to do the things I like, I go and spend it outside. I am a big fan of playing sports. I love basketball, pickleball, volleyball, and inner tube waterpolo. I love sitting outside and enjoying the sun and wonderful views of Provo. I also enjoy listening to self-development books, listening to music, and playing the guitar. </p>
                    <p class="mb-0">I am also a food enthusiast! When we get the chance, my girlfriend and I will go and try out a new restaurant. Provo has many hidden gems around here. Together we love to discover new things and explore town.</p>

                        <p>I was very blessed to grow up in a family where love was always present. I  always saw the good in my father: such a hard worker always wanting to provide and protect for his family. I saw the good in my mother: How well she would raise her kids and even work taking care of other kids. I quickly learned what I needed to be as a man and what a good mother looked for in a mother. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I grew up as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. This led me to many opportunities to serve. I served as the Youth Representative for our local area. This gave me the opportunity to grow my leadership skills as a young 15-18 year old. </p> 
                        <br>
                        <p> I am determined to accomplish my goals and will do anything to do so. I am not afraid to reach out to others and ask for help when needed.</p>
